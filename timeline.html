          <p>Tesla was born "at the stroke of midnight" with lightning striking during a summer storm. He was born to a Serbian family in Smiljan near Gospić, Lika, (the Military Frontier of Austria-Hungary, now in Croatia).</p>
          <p>The midwife commented, "He'll be a child of the storm," to which his mother replied, "No, of light."</p>

He attends "Higher Real Gymnasium" where teacher Martin Sekulić teaches him math and physics and has a decisive influence on him. Tesla graduates Gimnazije Karlovac a year early.</p>

        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>Tesla's Uncle Pavle arranges for Tesla to work for Ferenc Puskas at the Budapest Telephone Exchange in Hungary, which was then under construction. When Tesla arrived, he found that the new business was not anywhere near operational and instead worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became operational and Tesla was assigned the position of Chief Electrician. During his employment, Tesla made numerous improvements to the equipment and developed an amplifier device.</p>

          <h3>Tesla Has A.C. Epiphany</h3>
          <p>Tesla, obsessed with solving the riddle of A.C., suffers a mental breakdown and isn't expected to live. A short time later, Tesla begins to recover and during a walk in the Varosliget city park of Budapest with friend Anthony Szigety, the solution comes to Tesla in a vision. In his recollection of the event, Tesla states that he looked at the setting sun and began to recite a passage from Goethe's Faust. At that very moment the idea came to him in a flash and he drew a diagram of the motor in the sand with a stick.</p>

          <h3>Tesla Takes Job In Paris</h3>

        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>Tesla and his good friend Anthony Szigety accepted positions with the Continental Edison Company, which had recently been started in Paris. Tesla worked for Charles Batchelor at the Ivry-sur-Seine lamp factory and installed lighting systems in the Paris Opera House and a theater in Bavaria. He submitted a plan for improving the Edison dynamos to Mr. Rau, an administrator for the company. The plan was approved and soon Tesla's automatic regulator was gratefully accepted. Tesla was likely expecting to be compensated but was dispatched to Strasbourg before payment was awarded.</p>

          <h3>Tesla Arrives In New York</h3>
          <p>In the spring, Tesla, with funds provided by Uncles Petar and Pajo, packed his gear and caught the next boat for America. His trip didn't start too smoothly because his ticket, money and some of his luggage were stolen. To make matters worse, a mutiny broke out on the ship and Tesla was nearly thrown overboard. Through his strong resolve, Tesla was not deterred. He arrived in New York a few weeks later with four cents in his pocket, a few poems and remnants of his belongings.</p><br>

          <h3>Tesla Meets Edison</h3>
          <p>Some accounts state that Tesla started the very day he arrived in New York. Others put his start date on the following day. Regardless of the discrepancy, we know that Edison essentially hired Tesla on the spot but would hear nothing of his A.C. power system. Tesla was soon dispatched to Henry Villard's ocean liner, the Oregon, the first boat ever to have electric lighting. The set of dynamos that powered the ship were badly damaged and Edison was amazed to learn that Tesla had repaired them. He was quoted as calling Tesla "a damn good man." While Tesla worked for Edison he also installed and repaired incandescent and arc lamps, reassembled D.C. generators and designed twenty-four different types of machines that became standards replacing original Edison designs.</p>

          <h3>Tesla Electric Light Company</h3>
          <p>Investors approached Tesla and asked him to develop an improved arc lighting system. Although this was not the opportunity he had hoped for, the group was willing to finance the Tesla Electric Light Company in Rahway, New Jersey. The proud new owner set to work and invented a unique arc lamp of beautiful design and efficiency. After completing the work, Tesla was forced out of the company and left with nothing but worthless stock certificates. Tesla later referred to this as "the hardest blow" he'd ever received.</p>

          <h3>Tesla Quits Edison</h3>
          <p>At some point during Tesla's employment, Edison promises to pay him $50,000 if he can improve the performance of Edison's D.C. dynamo. Tesla succeeds beyond Edison's expectations, but he reneges on his promise to pay Tesla. Edison is quoted as stating to Tesla, "You don't understand our American humor." Deeply hurt, Tesla resigns. Some accounts state that Edison offers Tesla a raise if he will reconsider but Tesla declined.</p>

          <p>Betrayed by men he trusted, Tesla considered the winter of 1886/1887 a time of "terrible headaches and bitter tears." He was forced to work as a ditch digger for $2.00 per day and questioned the value of his education.</p><br>

          <h3>Tesla Electric Company</h3>
          <p>Tesla was introduced to Alfred S. Brown, director of Western Union, and Charles F. Peck, a New York City attorney, who were sold on his alternating current system after he demonstrated his "Egg of Columbus." Tesla agreed to split his patents on a fifty-fifty basis in exchange for funding. Brown located the laboratory at 89 Liberty St. and the company filed for its first patent by the end of the month.</p>

          <h3>1893 Chicago Worlds Fair</h3>
          <p>In 1892 George Westinghouse won the contract to power the Columbian Exposition. The Westinghouse company, with Tesla's guidance, built a power system for the exposition that produced three times more energy than was being utilized by the entire remainder of Chicago. Tesla had a large display including phosphorescent lighting (a precursor to fluorescent lamps) powered without wires by high-frequency fields and the Egg of Columbus. The success of the Tesla Polyphase System installed at the exposition ensured Westinghouse would be selected to harness Niagara.</p><br>

          <p>The new A.C. power system enjoyed a flawless inauguration, transmitting electricity to Buffalo, New York 22 miles away. It came first to the Buffalo Railway Company - 1,000 horsepower, switched into the company's powerhouses at exactly midnight with a signaling of the event to the city by the firing of cannons, the blowing of steam whistles and the ringing of bells.</p>
