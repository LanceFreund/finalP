                <h3>Arc Lamp</h3>
                <p>This invention relates more particularly to those arc-lamps in which the separation and feed of the carbon electrodes or their equivalents is accomplished by means of electromagnets or solenoids in connection with suitable clutch-mechanism.</p>

                <h3>Commutator for Dynamo</h3>
                <p>It is known that in machines of great electro-motive force - such, for instance, as those used for arc lights - whenever one commutator bar or plate comes out of contact with the collecting-brush a spark appears on the commutator.</p>

                <h3>Dynamo Regulator</h3>
                <p>The object of my invention is to provide an improved method for regulating the current on dynamo-electric machines. In my improvement I make use of two main brushes, to which the ends of the helices of the field-magnets are connected, and an auxiliary-brush and a branch or shunt-connection to form an intermediate pause in the circuit.</p>

                <h3>Thermo-Magnetic Motor</h3>
                <p>In my present invention I obtain mechanical power by a reciprocating action resulting from the joint operations of heat, magnetism, and a spring or weight or other force - that is to say, I subject a body magnetized by induction or otherwise to the action of heat until the magnetism is sufficiently neutralized.</p>

                <h3>Pyromagneto Generator</h3>
                <p>This invention is an improved form of electrical generator based upon the following well-known laws: First, that electricity or electrical energy is developed in any conducting-body by subjecting such body to a varying magnetic influence, and, second, that the magnetic properties of iron or other magnetic substance can effect it's performance.</p>

                <h3>Electrical Power Transmitter</h3>
                <p>The practical solution of the problem of the electrical conversion and transmission of mechanical energy involves certain requirements which the apparatus and systems heretofore employed have not been capable of fulfilling. Such a solution primarily demands a uniformity of speed in the motor irrespective of its load.</p>

                <h3>Electro-Magnetic Motor</h3>
                <p>In an application filed by me October 12, 1887, No. 252,132, I have shown and described a novel form of electro-magnetic motor and a mode of operating the same, which may be generally described as follows: The motor is wound with coils forming independent energizing-circuits on either the armature or field-magnet.</p>

                <p>As is well known, certain form of alternating-current machines have the property, when connected in circuit with an alternating-current generator, of running as a motor in synchronism therewith; but, while the the alternating current will run the motor after it has attained a rate of speed.</p>
